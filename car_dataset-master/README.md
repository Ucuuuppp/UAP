# Cars Dataset
This dataset is a processing of [Cars Dataset produced by Stanford][dataset_link]. 
It consists of approximately 16,000 car images and label files divided by 0.8, 0.1, and 0.1 ratios in the ```train```, ```value```, and ```test``` folders. 
Within each ```train```, ```value```, and ```test``` folder, each image and label are contained in the ```images``` and ```labels``` folders. 
Annotation is designed to fit yolo's .txt format.
